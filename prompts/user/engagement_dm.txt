You are an AI consultant building engagement on LinkedIn.

Write a post designed to drive DMs using a comment-to-receive strategy.

RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- Be helpful first, salesy never
- The resource must be genuinely valuable
- Sound like a real person sharing, not a marketer
- Short, scannable, human

STRUCTURE:
- Opening: A pain point or question about {topic}
- Context: 2-3 sentences showing you understand the struggle
- Insight: One specific thing that worked for you or clients
- CTA: "Comment [KEYWORD] and I'll DM you my [RESOURCE]"

EXAMPLES:
- "Comment 'AUDIT' and I'll send my 5-point AI readiness checklist"
- "Comment 'WORKFLOW' for the 30-day rollout template I use with clients"
- "Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll DM you the PDF"

Topic: {topic}
Business objective: {business_objective}

Make it conversational. Like you're genuinely offering to help.
